# Segmentation: Comparision between POSIR and basic data splitting data
# splitting:
# - observations with even index are used to obtain segmentation
# - observations with odd index are use to build confidence intervals

#  If $k$ is the (potentially random) number of regions in the final
#  segmentation, the confidence interval for the average value of $\mu$ in the
#  region $I$ will have as radius $q_\hat{\sigma}/\sqrt{\ell(I)/2}$, where
#  $\ell(I)$ is the length of $I$, the "/2" is due to the fact that only half of
#  the observations are used, and $q$ is the Gaussian quantile of level
#  $1-\alpha/(2k)$ (Bonferroniâ€™s rule). We compare with the radius of POSIR
#  confidence intervals $K_{1-\alpha,\delta} \hat{\sigma}/\sqrt{\ell(I)}$:
