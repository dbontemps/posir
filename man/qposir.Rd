\title{Quantile distribution of POSIR processes}
\usage{
qposir(p, delta, d = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{vector of probabilities.}

\item{delta}{vector of delta parameters;
when d==1, the delta parameters have to be in the interval [0.005, 1];
with d==2, the delta parameters have to be in the interval [0.01, 1];
in both cases, the estimated quantiles for delta very small are to be taken with caution.}

\item{d}{dimension: currently 1 and 2 are supported.}
}
\value{
A table of quantiles.
}
\description{
Extrapolates a quantile from the pre-computed estimated POSIR quantiles.
}
\examples{
qposir(c(0.9,0.95,0.99), .25)
}
