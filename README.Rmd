<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

## A Research project

`posir` is a help package to compute simulations in the framework defined in the preprint "Inference post region selection" by Bontemps, Bachoc, and Neuvial, 2025.

## What is it exactly for?

The goal of `posir` is to simulate trajectories of 1D or 2D POSIR processes, as defined in the paper. This allows to estimate quantiles as well as effective error levels of simultaneous confidence intervals.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `posir` as:

```r
remotes::install_github("dbontemps/posir")
```

## Available results

The results of the simulations presented in the paper, as well as the R scripts it used to exploit the package, are also included in the present repository.
